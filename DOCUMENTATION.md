## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Content
1. Images should be optimized and include responsive attributes
2. New components should follow the established patterns for error handling and performance
3. Use established color schemes and typography

### Code Structure
- Components are organized by feature
- Common UI elements are in the `/components/ui` directory
- Page layouts are in the `/pages` directory
- Utility functions are in the `/lib` directory

### Performance Considerations
- Continue using React.memo for components that rarely change
- Implement lazy loading for new large components
- Add ErrorBoundary components around new critical sections

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing caching for API responses
2. Add service worker for offline functionality
3. Implement analytics to track user behavior
4. Enhance SEO with structured data for recipes
