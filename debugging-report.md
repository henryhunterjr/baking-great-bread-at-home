# Recipe Converter Debugging Report

## Current Issues
1. Error messages appear when using any input method (text paste, file upload, camera)
2. PDF processing seems to get stuck at 10% progress
3. Type error in pdf-extractor.ts: "Namespace has no exported member 'TextContent'"
4. Possible incompatibility with Tesseract.js v6 API

## Affected Components
- Recipe Uploader (all tabs: text, file upload, camera, clipboard)
- PDF processing pipeline
- OCR processing

## Technical Environment
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- PDF.js (pdfjs-dist v5.0.375)
- Tesseract.js (v6.0.0)
- shadcn/ui components
- react-hook-form

## Error Details
1. PDF processing timeout: "PDF loading timed out"
2. OCR processing errors: Worker error or "Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker'" 
3. Type error in PDF extraction: "Namespace has no exported member 'TextContent'"
4. Possible form context issues: "Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState' of 'useFormContext(...)' as it is null"

## Code Analysis

### PDF Processing Pipeline
- The PDF extraction pipeline in `pdf-extractor.ts` has type incompatibilities with pdfjs-dist v5.0.375
- Worker initialization may be incorrect (`pdf.worker.min.js` path or configuration)
- Timeouts may be too aggressive for larger documents
- Error handling may not be properly propagating errors to the UI

### OCR Processing
- `ocr-processor.ts` may not be properly adapted for Tesseract.js v6 API
- The worker creation and management approach might be incompatible
- Progress reporting is using manual intervals instead of actual progress events

### File Upload Flow
- The cancellation mechanism may not be properly cleaning up resources
- Progress reporting might not accurately reflect actual processing status
- Error handling may be swallowing important details

## Potential Solutions

### PDF Processing Fixes
1. Update type assertions in `pdf-extractor.ts` to handle API changes in PDF.js v5
2. Verify worker configuration and paths (check if `/pdf.worker.min.js` exists and is accessible)
3. Review timeout values and ensure they scale with document size
4. Improve error propagation and ensure all promises have proper error handling

### OCR Processing Fixes
1. Update Tesseract.js integration to fully match v6 API requirements
2. Revise worker creation and lifecycle management
3. Implement proper progress handling that uses actual OCR progress when available

### UI and Integration Fixes
1. Ensure proper cleanup of workers and resources when component unmounts
2. Implement better error handling and user feedback
3. Verify all form contexts are properly initialized

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the Recipe Converter page
2. Attempt to upload a PDF file via the File Upload tab
3. Observe processing gets stuck at 10%
4. Try other tabs (text input, camera, clipboard) and observe errors

## Additional Context
- These issues appeared after recent refactoring to split PDF processing into smaller modules
- The application was working before updating to newer versions of PDF.js and Tesseract.js
- The placeholder worker file at `public/pdf.worker.min.js` may be too minimal to function properly

## Requested Action
Please analyze this report and provide:
1. Specific code fixes for each identified issue
2. Recommendations for architectural improvements
3. A plan to prevent similar issues in future updates
