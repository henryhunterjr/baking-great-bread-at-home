                <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                  Hi, I'm Henry. I didn't set out to become a bread baker. It started with a need, rent money, and a kind old baker named Mr. Sherman. I was stationed in Germany, just a young American soldier trying to stay afloat. Mr. Sherman was my landlord, a stout, spirited man who ran a small bakery downstairs. One day, he offered to lower my rent if I'd lend a hand in his shop. I think he saw more than just free labor, I think he saw someone who needed bread as much as bread needed him.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                What began as survival turned into a calling. When my tour of duty in Germany ended, I came back to the States and started working in radio advertising and marketing. I eventually moved into television, first with Fox, and later retired from CBS. But the lessons Mr. Sherman taught me never left.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                When I started baking again, it was just for fun. But like most of you know, once you get going, the bread starts piling upâ€”your freezer's full and there's more than you can eat. That's when my kids suggested I try selling at farmers markets. It went better than expected. I had a solid customer base and was baking from a small, makeshift bakery. Just as I was about to go all in, sign the lease, get the insurance, our governor shut the state down for COVID.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                After a week or two of doing nothing, I decided to give my customers something to do. I launched a Saturday morning bake-along and started a Facebook group called <strong>Baking Great Bread at Home</strong>, with help from my daughter Payton. Within a few weeks, we had 300 members and 13 people watching us live. We were so excited, we celebrated with sushi. Look at us now.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                Today, our community has grown beyond what I could have imagined. What started as a way to help my customers during lockdown has become a vibrant community of home bakers from all over the world. We share recipes, tips, and the joy of creating beautiful bread with our own hands.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                I believe that great bread doesn't need to be complicated. With the right techniques, quality ingredients, and a bit of patience, anyone can create bakery-quality bread at home. My goal is to demystify the art of bread making and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of experience level.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-gray-300">
                Through my books, tools, monthly challenges, and this online community, I hope to inspire you to roll up your sleeves and experience the satisfaction of creating something truly special with your own hands.
