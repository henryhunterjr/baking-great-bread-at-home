// Henry's biography
export const henryBio = {
  shortBio: "Henry's a former radio and television pro who came back to baking after retiring from CBS. The real spark started in a bakery in Germany, under the guidance of a stout Jewish baker named Mr. Sherman.",
  longBio: "Henry Vitale spent over 30 years in broadcast media before rediscovering his passion for bread baking. After retiring from his executive position at CBS, he returned to the craft he first learned as a young man working in a small German bakery under Mr. Sherman, a master baker who escaped Europe during WWII. Today, Henry combines old-world techniques with modern approaches to help home bakers create exceptional bread. His books and online community have inspired thousands to discover the joy and science of homemade bread.",
  achievements: "Author of four bread baking books, founder of the Baking Great Bread at Home community, and host of seasonal baking workshops across the country.",
  philosophy: "Bread baking isn't just about the loafâ€”it's about the process, the community, and the connection to tradition. Everyone deserves to experience the satisfaction of a well-baked loaf made with their own hands."
